A) 1) Faster Page Speed. More code means slower page speed. 
   2) Better User Experience. CSS not only makes web pages easy on the eye, it also allows for user-friendly formatting. 
   3) Quicker Development Time. 
   4) Easy Formatting Changes. 
   5) Compatibility Across Devices.

-> What are the disadvantages of CSS?
A) 1.) Confusion due to many CSS levels. Beginners are more vulnerable to this issue. ...
   2.) Cross-Browser Issues. Different browsers work differently. ...
   3.) Security Issues. Security is important in today's world driven by technology and data. ...

->What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3?
A) 1.) CSS :- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. Its main objective is to provide styling and fashion to the web page. CSS provides color, layout, background, font, and border properties. CSS features allow better content accessibility, enhanced flexibility, and control, as well as the specification of the characteristics of presentation.

   2.) CSS3: CSS3 stands for Cascading Style Sheet level 3, which is the advanced version of CSS. It is used for structuring, styling, and formatting web pages. Several new features have been added to CSS3 and it is supported by all modern web browsers. The most important feature of CSS3 is the splitting of CSS standards into separate modules that are simpler to learn and use.

-> Name a few CSS style components.
A) 	CSS style components

    1.) font-size.
    2.) width.
    3.) background-color.
    4.) color.
    5.) border. 

-> What do you understand by CSS opacity? 
A) The opacity CSS property sets the opacity of an element. Opacity is the degree to which content behind an element is hidden, and is the opposite of transparency.

-> How can the background color of an element be changed? 
A) To add background color in HTML, use the CSS background-color property. Set it to the color name or code you want and place it inside a style attribute. Then add this style attribute to an HTML element, like a table, heading, div, or span tag.

-> How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?
A) To control the repetition of an image in the background, use the background-repeat property. You can use no-repeat value for the background-repeat property if you do not want to repeat an image, in this case, the image will display only once.

-> What is the use of the background-position property? 
A) The background-position property sets the starting position of a background image. Tip: By default, a background-image is placed at the top-left corner of an element, and repeated both vertically and horizontally.

-> Which property controls the image scroll in the background? 
A) The background-attachment property sets whether a background image scrolls with the rest of the page, or is fixed.

-> Why should background and color be used as separate properties? 
A) There are two reasons behind this: It enhances the legibility of style sheets. The background property is a complex property in CSS, and if it is combined with color, the complexity will further increase.

->  How to center block elements using CSS1?
A) Block elements are those that are displayed at the start of a new line. A block element takes up the entire width of the content it is part of. Unlike inline, these elements have a top and bottom margin. Only the body tag is permitted to contain components at the block level. In comparison to inline components, block-level elements produce a larger structure. Examples of block elements are <div>, <article>, <section>, <li>, <ul>, <form>, <p>, etc. 

-> How to maintain the CSS specifications?
A) This page contains descriptions of all specifications that the CSS WG is working on. See the ‘current work’ page for a compact view and how to give feedback.

-> What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page?
A) CSS may be added to HTML in three different ways. To style a single HTML element on the page, use Inline CSS in a style attribute. By adding CSS to the head section of our HTML document, we can embed an internal stylesheet. We can also connect to an external stylesheet that separates our CSS from our HTML.

-> What is embedded style sheets?
A) An embedded style sheet is declared within the <head> element of an XHTML document. It applies to the whole document, rather than just one element. Each style declaration (or CSS rule) gets applied to everything in the document that matches that rule.


-> What are the external style sheets? 
A) An external style sheet is a separate CSS file that can be accessed by creating a link within the head section of the webpage. Multiple webpages can use the same link to access the stylesheet. The link to an external style sheet is placed within the head section of the page.

-> What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?
A)                 Disadvantages of External CSS:

1.) Your pages may not be rendered correctly until the external CSS is loaded.
2.) Uploading or linking to multiple CSS files can increase your site's download time.
 
                   Advantage of External CSS:

1.)  Using them, the styles of multiple documents can be controlled from one file.
2.)  Classes can be created for use on multiple HTML element types in many documents.
3.)  In complex situations, selector and grouping methods can be used to apply styles.
 

-> What is the meaning of the CSS selector?
A)  A pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them.

-> What are the media types allowed by CSS? 
A) The media types allowed by CSS are:

1.) continuous or paged.
2.) visual, audio, speech, or tactile.
3.) grid (for character grid devices), or bitmap.
4.) interactive (for devices that allow user interaction), or static (for those that do not).
5.) all (includes all media types) 

-> What is the rule set? 
A) A table of instructions used by a controlled interface to determine what data is allowable and how the data is handled between interconnected systems.
